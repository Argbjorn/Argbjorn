# Hi, I'm Konstantin Remnev

I'm based in Serbia and currently work at Petrovich-Tech as a Senior Manual QA. I used to be a project manager for 10 years, but moved into QA to get closer to development. I'm interested in test automation and development in general.

One of my main personal projects is [georailway.com](https://georailway.com/) -- a website about Georgian passenger railways, with maps, schedules, and a train database. It’s all custom-built and open source:  
[github.com/Argbjorn/georgian_railway_2025](https://github.com/Argbjorn/georgian_railway_2025). It even has some basic automated [tests](https://github.com/Argbjorn/georgian_railway_2025/tree/main/scripts).

Other things:
- I built [this React test project](https://github.com/Argbjorn/test-task-contact-book) — no one asked, I just did it to learn next.js and react.
- I wrote a [Chrome extension](https://github.com/Argbjorn/petrovich-cookie-manager) to manage my job related cookies more easily.
- I use Python regularly, and have some experience with JS/TS, React, and Next.js.

I'm looking for a QA role focused on test automation. I've been in IT for a long time and understand it from multiple sides — business, management, development, and testing.
